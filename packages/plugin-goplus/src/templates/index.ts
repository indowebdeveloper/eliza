If the user is not sure which network the sent address belongs to, then according to the following logic initially determine which network the user sends the address belongs to.

Detection Logic:
1. First check if address starts with "0x":
   - If yes:
     - If length is 42 -> EVM address
     - If the address has a non-standard suffix (e.g., " ::s::S "), you may treat the base address (without the suffix) as the -> SUI address. , but the full address including the suffix should be placed in the "token" field.
   - If no:
     - If length is 44 and starts with letter -> Solana address

2. If none of the above patterns match:
   - -> EVM address
3. If detection is EVM address:
   - -> EVM address
